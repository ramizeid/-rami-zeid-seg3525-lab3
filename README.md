### Changes Made
One can notice a couple of differences between the older & newer version of the grocery website. The two personas that
I created in my last assignment can be described as follows:

- Michel is a 35 year old architect who only speaks French. Due to his handicap, he has difficulties going to a physical
grocery store, and as such, is essentially forced to shop online. Michel is knows how the technology works, since he's
used other e-commerce platforms in the past.

- Connor, on the other hand, is a 26 year old owner of a startup company who only speaks English. Since he's at work most
of the day, he doesn't have time to go shopping at a physical grocery store, and is therefore forced to shop online.
He is quite impatient, and does not used to shopping online, and hence has very little experience using e-commerce
platforms such as this website.

As such, I've decided to make the following changes to the website in order to address Michel and Connor's needs without
disregarding Nara and Yao's needs either:

- Added a translation feature. Users can view the website in English or French, depending on the language that they're
more comfortable with. This addresses the issue of Michel only speaking French, and Connor only speaking English.

- Changed the budget selection system from a dropdown list to a range slider. This addresses Michel's impatience and 
lack of time, since he should be able to specify his budget with less clicks, and can therefore shop more quickly.

- Added a category column to the list of available products table. This new feature also addresses Michel's impatience
and lack of time, since it allows him to pin-point the products that he'd like to purchase with more ease (and quicker
than usual), which allows him to shop more quickly.

- Added a product picture column to the list of available products table. This feature helps the customers view the 
products that they are about to purchase, since they're shopping online.
